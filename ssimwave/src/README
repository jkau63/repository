usage: luma <number of threads> <directory of video files>

assumptions:

1) Only 1 thread is used per file
    Doing a multi-thread decode on a singel stream is possible but complicated and
    therefore probably beyond the scope of this probject.  If the number of thread
    is > the number of files in the directory a warning will appear.
2) Only YUV color space is supported
    Content in 4:4:4 color space does exist but is not common.  Unpredictable behavior will
    occur if this content is discovered.

warnings:
1) Non-deterministic behavior was discovered for the U and V color componenets when running multi-threaded
    The values of RY and BY were not always the same on the same frame of copies of the same clip evaluated 
    on different threads.  I interpreted this to be either non-thread-safe behavior in ffmpeg or 'don't care'
    values occupying RY/BY for extremely high or low luma values which will be properly handled through clipping when
    converting color space.  I didn't actually determine the cause but it is worth investigating.
    In any event, the decoded luma value were always deterministic.
